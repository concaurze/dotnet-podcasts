RouterOS also supports different license levels, which determine the available features and limitations of the system. For example, license level 4 allows up to 200 wireless clients and 200 PPPoE tunnels, while license level 6 allows unlimited wireless clients and PPPoE tunnels. The license levels are described in more detail [here].
     
One of the features of RouterOS is the ability to use super channels, which are frequencies outside of the standard WiFi bands. For example, some RouterOS devices can operate in the 2.7 GHz or 6 GHz bands, which may offer less interference and more bandwidth than the crowded 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands. However, using super channels requires a special license and a permission from the local authorities.

Mikrotik super channel license 13 is a type of license that allows the use of super channels on RouterOS devices. It is not for sale individually, but it can be obtained as a part of a bundle with some Mikrotik hardware products. For example, the [LHG XL HP5] is a high-power wireless device that comes with a super channel license 13 included.
     
To use super channels on RouterOS devices, you need to have a valid super channel license key and paste it into the router. You also need to make sure that the other device you are connecting to supports the same frequency, and that the antenna you are using can work well on that frequency. You can find more information about super channels on this [forum thread].
     
Using super channels can offer some advantages, such as less interference, higher throughput, and wider coverage. However, there are also some drawbacks, such as lower antenna gain, higher power consumption, and legal restrictions. Therefore, before using super channels, you should carefully consider your needs and options, and consult with your local authorities.
